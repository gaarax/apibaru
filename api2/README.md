# [HumHub](https://github.com/humhub/humhub) Api
# NOTE: I no longer have time to support or edit this module. If you would like to become a contributor/author, and maintain it please contact me.  It was my understanding that an official API would be forthcoming, but I haven't been able to keep up with humhub in several months.

## Pre-Release v 0.9

This module is for HumHub Version 0.20 (Yii 2) and greater and cannot be used with HumHub Version 0.1x (Yii 1.1)

## Description

This module implements a RESTful API for Humhub installations.  Returning JSON or XML, developers can make use of
the end points to create applications, implement combined logins, create AJAX web applications, etc.

Only core module access is supported, not optional plugins.

All api calls require an access token (api_key).  Access granted via the admin panel via database authentication.

Sample Call: http://localhost/user/search/:text?access_token=:api_key

Sample Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<response>
   <Comment>

      <message>Nike – Just buy it. ;Wink;</message>

 {
    "containerClass": "humhub\\modules\\space\\models\\Space",
    "message": "test",
    "user_id": 1,

## Installation
1. Download the module and upload it to your modules directory >yourdomain.com>protected>modules
2. Rename module directory ```api``` (May not be required!)
3. Enable module from >Admin>Modules

## Requirements
This Module requires pretty urls to be enabled - see: https://www.humhub.org/docs/guide-admin-installation.html#4-fine-tuning

## Known Issues:
1. Cannot update a public post.  Will investigate after rest of data is complete.
2. Adding posts is a bit ugly. The underlying code expects Ajax and has some post variables we need to duplicate

## TODO
See Issues for list of TO-DO's
